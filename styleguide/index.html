<h2>1. General Concepts</h2>




<h3>Build HTML from Pre-made UI Pieces</h3>

<p>New pages should not generally require much additional CSS. We should spend most of our time caring for our reusable framework components so new pages can quickly be built from them. <strong>More systems thinking. Less page-level building.</strong></p>

	</li>
</ul>





<h3>Separate Structure and Skin</h3>

<p>Many components have a similar layout but different visual treatments. By separating the structural properties we can reuse them.</p>

	</li>
</ul>





<h3>Separate Container and Content</h3>

<p><em>As much as possible</em>, we make pieces of UI that are unopinionated about:</p>

<ul class="c-list c-list--bullets u-margin-bottom">
	<li class="c-list__item">the type of elements they can contain</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">the container they are located in</li>
</ul>

<p>They will behave predictably regardless of how they are nested in the HTML. This means we end up with elements that can be safely combined in many different ways.</p>

<p>There are occasional exceptions to the rule but they are always justified.</p>

	</li>
</ul>





<h3>Don't Overdesign, Don't Over-engineer</h3>

<p>We make the necessary tradeoffs to <strong>keep our framework simple</strong>. We strike a balance between the features we need and the costs of implementation, maintenance and scalability.</p>

<p>Example one:<br>
	We don't write overly complex Sass mixins for the sake of keeping our code a tiny bit DRYer. Every time a co-worker has to read through our mixins, it costs them time and energy. Often more than the actual code savings are actually worth. Don't write a five line mixin to generate 10 lines of CSS. In that case copypasting is faster and easier to read.</p>

<p>Example two:<br>
	We don't make responsive variations of the same component look drastically different because it will force us to make that component too flexible and therefore, too complex. The implementation and maintenance costs are greater than the value for the user.</p>

<h3>CSS and HTML that is Useful for Developers</h3>

<p>Nicholas Gallagher outlined this in the following post:</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/</a>
</p>

<p>Regarding class names:</p>

<blockquote><p>not all semantics need to be content-derived</p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding the fear of overusing so-called "unsemantic" HTML (sometimes known as "divitis"):</p>

<blockquote><p>We shouldn’t be afraid to include additional HTML elements if they help create more robust,
	flexible, and reusable components. Doing so does not make the HTML “unsemantic”, it just means
	that you use elements beyond the bare minimum needed to markup the content.</p></blockquote>

	</li>
</ul>





<h3>Clarity over Brevity</h3>

<p>We prefer to write class names that are as informative as possible about what they do and what they are related to (even if this means making them more verbose).</p>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">We rarely use cryptic abbreviations.</p>




<h3>Mobile First</h3>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">By default we design for the smallest screens and breakpoints allow us to override default values on larger screens. Therefore almost all our breakpoints are min-width.</p>





<h3>Sizing Units</h3>

<p>We establish font-sizes in REMs so we can change them easily on mobile.</p>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">Margins, paddings, etc. use px instead of REMs because we want them to be independent from font sizes. For example, on mobile we may want smaller text but more padding (to improve touch target size).</p>




<h3>Flexbox Grid</h3>

<p>Our layout object uses flexbox. It allows us to do everything traditional grids can and much more.</p>

	</li>
</ul>




<h3>Browser Support</h3>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">We support the 2 latest versions of IE. Most of what we've built works in "modern browsers" several versions back. We do not support minority browsers like Opera.</p>




<h3>Minimal Nesting</h3>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">Whenever possible we avoid nesting in order to prevent unnecessary specificity.</p>




<h3>!important</h3>

<p>!important is used -almost- exclusively in utility classes (named "trumps" in ITCSS).</p>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">Putting it anywhere else would make it difficult to override. Utilities are the last layer in ITCSS precisely because they are meant to override anything else. The risk of them needing to be overridden is practically nonexistent.</p>





<hr class="u-margin-top-large u-margin-bottom-large">




<h2>2. Methodologies</h2>




<h3>ITCSS</h3>

<p>We follow the ITCSS methodology. This involves organising styles according to specificity. For example, we don't put styles for <em>form elements</em> and <em>form classes</em> in the same file. Element styles are located in one file and classes in another. Since element selectors are less specific, they are imported earlier than classes.</p>

<p>Layers described in the ITCSS methodology:</p>

<ol class="c-list u-margin-bottom">
	<li class="c-list__item"><strong>Settings</strong><br>
		Variables and config that are used globally throughout the project.</li>
	<li class="c-list__item"><strong>Tools</strong><br>
		Globally-available functions and mixins.</li>
	<li class="c-list__item"><strong>Generic</strong><br>
		Far-reaching, very low specificity selectors. It is usually used for reset, normalisation, etc.</li>
	<li class="c-list__item"><strong>Elements</strong><br>
		Bare, unclassed HTML elements. What does an H1 element look like without a class on it? What does an A element look like without a class on it?</li>
	<li class="c-list__item"><strong>Objects</strong><br>
		Non-cosmetic design patterns. Any piece of UI that is purely structural, and doesn’t have any look-and-feel.</li>
	<li class="c-list__item"><strong>Components</strong><br>
		Discrete, self-contained pieces of UI. Your dropdown menu, your carousel, your price-comparison module.</li>
	<li class="c-list__item"><strong>Trumps</strong><br>
		Utilities, helpers, overrides, and hacks. It takes its name from the English word trump, which means to beat (someone or something) by saying or doing something better.</li>
</ol>

</ul>





<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>Objects are structural abstractions that mainly handle layout. Example: our layout object is a grid system completely devoid of any skin. Its sole purpose is to distribute elements throughout the page.</p>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">Objects usually have no "look and feel" properties. If they ever require any visual styling it is only because that styling is <em>unquestionably essential to their purpose</em>. And even then, any colors, borders, etc. are kept neutral. They should look like they could be used on any other site. A table, for example, will require some kind of styling to help users clearly scan each row.</p>





<h4>Components</h4>

<p>Components are where most of the "look and feel" is located. They are the specific pieces of UI that non-developers would normally refer by name to when speaking about an interface: "main menu", "CTA button", "testimonial", etc.</p>

<p>Components will sometimes depend on objects but they can also exist on their own.</p>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">If you are building an object and it seems to have some opinionated "look and feel" properties that might be an indication it should be a component. If you are in doubt about whether something should be an object or a component, then use a component just to be on the safe side.</p>





<h4>States and Modifiers</h4>

<p>Modifiers are permanent variations of a component or an object. Examples could be .c-button--large, .c-button--small, .c-button--primary, .c-button--secondary.</p>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">States are temporary variations of a component or an object, that are triggered by JavaScript. Examples could be .is-open, .is-closed, .is-collapsed, .is-expanded.</p>





<h4>Utilities</h4>

<p>Utilities are high-specificity classes meant for occasional overrides. They tend to override a single CSS property by making use of !important. You should rarely need them. Watch out if you find yourself:</p>

<ul class="c-list c-list--bullets u-margin-bottom">
	<li class="c-list__item">adding several to the same element</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">adding the same ones to similar elements in different contexts</li>
</ul>

<p class="u-margin-bottom-large">In these cases you should stop and consider whether the styling you need should simply be part of a new modifier class for the object or component you are tweaking.</p>





<h3>BEM-like Class Names</h3>

<p>BEM-like naming conventions help us identify at a glance:</p>

<ul class="c-list c-list--bullets u-margin-bottom">
	<li class="c-list__item">The root element of an object or component.</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">Child elements that are context-dependent: they only make sense in the context of the parent they belong to.</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">Optional modifiers that alter appearance or behavior.</li>
</ul>


<p>Basic naming conventions:</p>

<pre><code>.prefix-component {}
	.prefix-component--modifier {}
	.prefix-component__child {}
	.prefix-component__child--modifier {}
</code></pre>

<p>Using our layout object as an example:</p>

<pre><code>.o-layout {}
	.o-layout--vertical {}
	.o-layout__item {}
	.o-layout__item--shrink {}
</code></pre>

<p>We add extra prefixes to our classes to help us further understand the function they perform:</p>

<ul class="c-list c-list--bullets u-margin-bottom">
	<li class="c-list__item">o- denotes an object</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">c- denotes a component</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">u- denotes a utility class</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">is- , has- denote temporary behaviors often invoked by JS (do not confuse with modifier classes)</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">js- denotes a class that is used exclusively as a hook for Javascript</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">qa- denotes a class used for quality assurance</li>
	<li class="c-list__item">t- denotes a class that applies a specific theme/skin</li>
</ul>


<p>Another advantage is good autocompletion in our code editor and improved searching.</p>

<p>Here are some component examples.</p>

<p>Parent and child elements:</p>

<pre><code>.c-nav {} // Parent
	.c-nav__item {} // Add to any LI element
	.c-nav__link {} // Add to any A element
</code></pre>

<p>Modifiers for a parent element:</p>

<pre><code>.c-box // Parent
	.c-box--primary {} // Primary brand colour
	.c-box--secondary {} // Secondary brand colour
</code></pre>

<p>Modifier for a child element:</p>

<pre><code>
	.c-box__link--primary // Change colour of a link in a .c-box--primary
</code></pre>
